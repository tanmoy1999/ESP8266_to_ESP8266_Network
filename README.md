# ESP8266_to_ESP8266_Network
Locally connecting two NodeMCU to communicate and send data from one network to other. This will enable a wireless remote connection between two devices without using Arduino with wifi module. 



#### Troubleshooting

* if the light is not turning on 
   Server----> Output
   Client----> Input

    If you want to reset the server. You can reset the server any time when it is connected to the client
    If you want to reset the client. You need to reset both SERVER and CLIENT at the same time. 

* if step (1) is not working
    ---> Arduino IDE-->tools-->Erase Flash--> Sketch + WiFiSettings
    ---> Run the "Blink" code from (Arduino IDE-->File-->examples--> ESP8266-->Blink) example to reset the memory settings BOTH nodeMCU
    ---> Run the main code

* else Interchange NodeMCU and Code
